# hw12-employeeTracker


As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business


This assignemnt was to create an employee tracker system that would allow the user to:
- Add New Employee
- Add A New Role
- Add A New Department
- Update Employee's Role
- View All Employees
- View All Departments
- View All Roles



I was able to start and get a good way through it, but was unable to complete it due to running out of time. But I will work on this more to finish it.
